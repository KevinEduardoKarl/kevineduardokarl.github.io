My subject matter expertise sits at the intersection of agriculture, climate change, and social equity. I have spent nearly a decade working in food and agriculture as a farmer, food security professional, and community advocate focusing on food justice. Throughout my educational career I have centered the scientific, economic, and policy considerations that connect our food system, climate, and the vitality of our communities.
