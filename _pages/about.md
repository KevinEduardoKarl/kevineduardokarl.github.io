I'm a data and research analyst who excels at exploratory analysis, machine learning, and data visualizations. I have broad experience in quantitative and qualitative research in a number of domains, including; urban policy, climate change, healthcare and agriculture. As a former organic farmer, I am a practitioner at heart with a strong desire to make a positive, real world impact.
