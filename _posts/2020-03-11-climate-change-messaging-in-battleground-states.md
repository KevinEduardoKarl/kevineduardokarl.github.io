# How should the Democratic nominee talk about climate change reform in three key battleground states in 2020?

Climate change is widely regarded of the most pressing issues of our time, yet it is has been notoriously difficult to mobilize national political action to address the problem. Whoever secures the Democratic nomination for President will need to be able to sell his or her vision for climate reform around the country— and must be particularly effective at pitching that vision in battleground states where it will be challenged harshly by critics and opponents.

This analysis employs a series of polls conducted by The Associate Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey was conducted through mail, email, telephone, and field interviews between November 14 and 19, 2018 with adults over 18. The overall margin of sampling error is 3.9% points. The results of the survey were weighted using age, gender, census division, race/ethnicity and education obtained from the 2018 Current Population Survey.

## How motivated are people on climate reform amongst a host of other policy priorities?

From the national poll:

### Insight #1:
As much as possible, it is crucial to focus on the economic impacts of the climate change plan. When pressed, continue to frame the climate reform plan as an economic plan, and, if possible, highlight any relevant positive health implications that may derive from climate action (especially in communities hit hard by pollution and smog).

## How about key constituents in important battleground states?

In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost in the crucial states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which were critical to Donald Trump’s Presidential victory. Furthermore, [according to analysis conducted by Nate Silver](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/), educational attainment was the key indicator that predicted who would vote for Trump in 2016.

Therefore, the survey results were filtered to examine how different educational attainment segments in those key states responded to the same question as above.

In this figure (n=120), it is apparent that highly educated people (BA or above) are already on board and care about the issue. Note here that the “No High School Diploma” subpopulation should be discounted because it only represents 5 people.

The key populations to go after in these states are clearly the “HS graduate or equivalent” and “some college” segments. From the figure it is apparent those segments care less about climate change overall. However, that does not mean that they cannot be persuaded to care more. Crucially, they tend to already believe that climate change is at least moderately important. Therefore, these segments represent the largest pool of people that can be brought on board to care about the issue in a significant way.

### Insight #2:

Focus on people who have HS graduate degree or equivalent and some college education in order to grow the coalition that is positively oriented, and perhaps even motivated, on the issue.It is less important to spend resources on people who have a BA or above, as they are already largely on board. In fact, communicating climate reform to this segment may backlash, since climate change tends to become more polarized with educational attainment.

## Which messages are most likely to persuade this constituent group?

The next question summarizes varying support for ways to spend any tax revenue incurred from some form of carbon tax. The results are segmented by the key subpopulations that we are looking at: people who have somewhere between a high school diploma and some college under their belt without getting a full BA or equivalent degree, who reside in MI, WI, or PA. Each value is in percentage points.

Question: “Would you support, oppose or neither support nor oppose taxing the emissions of carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas if the tax revenue was used to:”

It turns out the the three most popular ideas (highest net support) for folks with high school or some college is:
* Natural restoration
* Research
* Tax rebate

The least popular ideas were:
* Ease climate regulations
* Public transportation
* Reduce federal deficit

### Insight #3:

The Democratic nominee should communicate clearly about how any tax revenue from the climate reform plan will be spent, and try to focus on these ideas instead of the costs of reform. In particular, it would be wise to focus on parts of the climate reform plan that involve natural restoration projects, renewable energy research, and any tax rebates that may land in people’s pockets. As much as possible, the nominee should pivot from from a conversation about costs to an explanation of these specific benefits.

### Summary

In order to beat Donald Trump in the general election it is crucial to appeal to the political preferences of voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The topic of climate reform will arise, and, because of this, the Democratic nominee must be prepared to talk about climate reform in those states from an informed standpoint. By framing the discussion of climate reform on the economy, targeting key segments of the population (like people with HS degrees but no BA or equivalent), and emphasizing the beneficial projects that can be funded by a climate bill, the Democratic nominee may be able to secure a win in 2020 that ladders into a larger victory for the world.
