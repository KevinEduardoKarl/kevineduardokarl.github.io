I'm a data and research analyst who excels at project management, communications, and data-driven strategic development. My subject matter expertise lies at the intersection of food, climate, and social policy. I have broad experience in quantitative and qualitative research in a number of domains, including but not limited to; urban policy, climate change, healthcare and agriculture. As a former organic farmer, I am a practitioner at heart with a strong desire to make a positive, real world impact. My hobbies include writing and producing music, gardening, and cooking.
