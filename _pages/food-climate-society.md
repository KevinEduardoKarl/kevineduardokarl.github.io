My subject matter expertise sits at the intersection of agriculture, climate change, and social policy. I have spent nearly a decade working in food and agriculture as a farmer, food security professional, and community advocate. Throughout my educational career I have focused on the scientific, economic, and policy considerations that connect the food system, climate, and community well-being.
