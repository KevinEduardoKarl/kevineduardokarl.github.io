## Soil management practices have caught up with ruminant fermentation as a share of global greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.

Let's get the details out of the way first. This data is taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and contains data from 1961-2017. There's an obvious bump in greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions in 1990- not because the world's farmers suddenly went wild for a year, but because the FAO included a couple of new indicators to their overall tally at that time.

The main trends here are clear, while most indicators are clearly rising, the two main contributors— enteric fermentation and agricultural soils— are rising at different rates. At the current pace, it appears that agricultural soil management will catch, and then surpass, enteric fermentation as the number one cause of GhG emissions from agriculture.

## What is enteric fermentation? What is included in "agricultural soils"?
### The distinction is not as simple as animal agriculture vs. cropland agriculture.

According to the FAO, GhG emissions from enteric fermentation are composed of "methane gas produced in digestive systems of ruminants and to a lesser extent of non-ruminants." Methane is a potent greenhouse gas up with up 30 times the heat-trapping potential as Carbon Dioxide. Fortunately, it does not last in the atmosphere for nearly as long. Still, the contributions of our current system of animal agriculture towards overall GhG emissions is staggering.

Emissions associated with agricultural soils in this analysis is a combination of a few indicators, namely, emissions associated with synthetic fertilizers, manure applied to soils, manure applied to pasture, the cultivation of organic soil, and crop residue management. The fact that these emissions are rising as a share of overall emissions is concerning, however, much of these emissions can be mitigated with climate-smart farming practices.

A key thing to note here is that some of the indicators that the FAO attributes to "agricultural soils" involve manure management. This is a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the inefficient integration of manure into crop systems and pastures is certainly a by-product of poor soil management practices. On the other hand, there would be less manure to misapply to soils if there were less animals overall, and if animal agriculture was more carefully integrated into a climate-smart farming plan. At the end of the day, agriculture needs to be thought of holistically— these indicators may appear separate on the graph but they all depend on heavily on each other.

## The trends are similar in the United States, which is perhaps what the global mix will look like in the future.

Here, it appears that the emissions from agricultural soils surpassed those from enteric fermentation in the U.S. in the mid-80s roughly. Clearly, emissions from enteric fermentation start to drop around then, for reasons that are not apparent in this dataset (but would be interesting to look into). Unfortunately, emissions from ruminant fermentation has seen a sharp uptick in the past five years in the U.S. Emissions from agricultural soils, however, has risen steadily since the late 1980's.

## China is showing a similar pattern to the U.S., with synthetic fertilizers leading the way.

China, the second highest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, shows a similar trend. Interestingly, synthetic fertilizers seem to contribute a higher share of the agricultural soils emissions in China. Indeed, in both the U.S. and China, "synthetic fertilizers" is the indicator that contributes most forcefully to agricultural soils emissions.

### How do synthetic fertilizers contribute to the problem?

According to the FAO, emissions from synthetic fertilizers "consist of nitrous oxide gas from synthetic nitrogen additions to managed soils". It does not appear to take into account the energy required to create synthetic fertilizers, which also produces a substantial amount of GhG emissions. Still, the findings here are fascinating. Without going too deep into soil biochemistry, the emissions being counted here are related to the misapplication of synthetic fertilizers in farming systems.

Sound familiar? This the same essential issue behind emissions that stem from manure applied to soil and pasture systems. There are so many underlying factors that make it difficult to apply just the right amount of fertilizer, whether it is manure or synthetic fertilizers, to soils. Temperature, moisture, and the complexity of soil structure and wide range soil types are but a few of the variables to consider. Soil pH is important, as is soil microbiology. As far as the farmer is concerned, it is far better to over-apply fertilizer than to under-apply them.

### How can we address the rising emissions stemming from poor management of agricultural soils?

Fortunately, we have the knowledge and resources at our disposal to effectively mitigate GhG emissions associated with  There is a long list of climate-smart agricultural practices that also make business sense for farmers. What the transition from conventional practices to climate-smart practices looks like, and what governments can do to aide in that transition, is a key research interest of mine and should be a focus for people working at the intersection of food and climate going forward.
